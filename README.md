School of Code - BAE Systems Hackathon
Context
We live in a world where our the negative impact of human beings on the environment (eg climate change, loss of habitats and bio-diversity) is evident for us all to see
As a business BAE Systems has committed to achieving net zero emissions in its operations by 2030, whilst working toward net zero in its value chain by 2050.  In Digital Intelligence our biggest contributors to our carbon footprint are likely to be IT and compute resources and our offices, plus the energy our employees expend in travel and home working
Your brief
If you were working for a large company, like BAE Systems, how could you use a web app to promote sustainability, to individuals and software development project teams and / or to IT operational teams?
You might want to think about how you make teams aware of their carbon footprint or to suggest ways that company employees can reduce their own or the company’s carbon footprint.  You may even want to consider the carbon footprint of your proposed web app
Alternatively you might want to promote other areas of sustainability such as recycling or reducing use of plastic
Success
At the end of the Hackathon we want you to articulate your team’s idea(s) and, if possible, demo those ideas coming to life eg hi-fi wireframes, a demo UI
You should also be able to talk about what would be in scope for an MVP and what technology choices you would make
Whatever you do the key success criteria is to engage your users, the employees / teams in the company, through the app

This is our answer to the above project scope.

we created an app which gamifys the experience of saving the world by educating our sustainability knowledge. This is done by bringing knowledge on carbon footprint and self awareness.

our project aims to allow the company to set quizzes and tasks to earn points.  these ccan be changed quarterly to develop th xp.
the scores are tallied by individual and potentially by deptb and site allowing competition andd reward.  This also allows copanies ton advertise their priogress and their position in reducing the carbbon footprint.

Thank you
